      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Our purpose here at Dry Raft is to provide a unique and fun bonding experience for families, friends, and youth groups. This website is for easy access to book a ride, learn more information, to answer questions, to give contact info, dates and times of availability, learn the history, testimonials, and more. We want to attract people to our website and sell them on this magical ride. We want to convince them this is a great deal, and the best thing they could do with their family to bring it together. We also want them to know how safe it is, and all the precautions we take.</p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience is mostly going to be families and young adults. One of the people that I will be specifically targeting is Kim, a 40 year old woman. She has 3 kids between the ages of 16 and 10. She and her husband work and are in the upper middle class ($120,000/yr). They take summer vacations and travel every year. Their youngest is old enough that they feel like they can expand the horizons of their adventures a little more. They would most likely look at my website from their phone or laptop while they were doing research for their next vacation.</p>

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
