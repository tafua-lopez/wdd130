            <p class="who-we-are"><b>We are a team of trained proffesionals that specialize in the grooming and care for felines. We started our company in 2001 after realizing that many groomers don't know how to properly groom cats. This would often lead to poor feline-groomer experiences, as well as sometimes harm befalling both groomers and felines. We believed that was avoidable and set out to find solutions. We are proud to say we have been successful. Click to learn more about our team members!</b>  </p>

We love the service that Whiskers provides, and even Darth (our Maine Coon) loves it as well! His favorite part is the treat at the end. They are so gentle and caring with him.
