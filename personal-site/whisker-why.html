                        <h5>Don't cats groom themselves?</h5>
                        <div>
                            <p>Cat's groom their coat by licking it with their sandpaper like tongue. Dog's also groom themselves with their tongue, but we still take them to get groomed regularly. Just because they lick themselves does not mean thier coat is clean. They also generally can only reach their top coat with their tongue, leaving their bottom coat to fend for itself.  </p>

                        <h5>Aren't baths are bad for cats?</h5>
                        <div>
                            <p>Baths are only harmful for cats if they aren't bathed properly. If water gets into their ears it can cause an infection. If they are bathed too often, or without the right soaps it can dry their skin out and cause skin issues. If bathing is done right it is actually very beneficial for your kitty! It is very easy to avoid these issues, and thats what we aim for here at Whisker.</p>

                        <h5>Can't I just declaw my cat instead of getting them trimmed?</h5>
                        <div>
                            <p>While this practice is still legal in some states this is highly discouraged, and unethical. When a cat is declawed, it is the equivalent to cutting off your finger at one of your knuckles. This more often than not leaves your cat in a lot of pain for the rest of their life to even just walk. We can apply nail caps for your cat at your grooming appointment that will stop their destructive damage and it will stay on for about 4-6 weeks. Cats usually hardly even notice they are wearing them and do not harm the cat.</p>

                        <h5>Less Hairballs</h5>
                        <div>
                            <p>Since cats do groom themselves quite a bit, they ingest a lot of fur. Usually this isn't a problem, but in some cats they are prone to hairballs. Hairballs occur when their is a build up of hair that causes a blockage and is puked up. Repreatedly puking hairballs up can deteriorate their esophagus and cause long term issues. When you get your cat groomed reguarly, we blowdry and wash out a lot of hair that would've otherwise been ingested, meaning less hairballs!</p>

                        <h5>No Matting</h5>
                        <div>
                            <p>All cats, but especially long haired and senior cats are able to gets matts. Matts are not fun for your kitties and is generally painful as it causes their skin to pull and in some cases even rip. Gone untreated, this can lead to skin infections and other issues. When they are groomed we are removing dirt, excess skin, and hair build up at the base of their coat that often is the root cause for matting. When groomed on a regular basis you can avoid matting all together!</p>

                            <p>We are not trained vetinarians and cannot give diagnosees, but we can sometimes spot when something is off. Often times we are seeing parts of your animal that you might not always see. If we do spot something that looks abnormal and let you know! There have been quite a few times that we have spotted something and saved a cat's life.</p>

                        <h5>Bathing</h5>
                        <div>
                            <p>The first thing we like to do is get your kitty scrubbed up! We have sensitive organic shampoos that won't irritate your cat's skin. We are careful to not get their heads wet, and bathe them in luke warm water. They are hooked to a leash that keeps them from running around, and if your cat is feisty, no worries! We have an "astronaut helmet" that will keep them from biting us but allows them to breath and see. We also trim their nails before hand. Usually cats meow a bit at this part but will calm down when they realize they are safe. </p>

                        <h5>Drying</h5>
                        <div>
                            <p>After a nice wash and rinse, we take our kitties to the drying station. It is like a clear box with a blowdryer for the floor. Sometimes this can scare cats, and sometimes they absolutely love it! If your cat is timid, we have an open ended sock that fits over their head. They can see and breath out of this as well, but studies have shown, and our experience, that this greatly decreases stress in cats. While they are being blow dryed we brush them out detangling thair hair, and using a special brush to get to their undercoat.</p>

                        <div>
                            <p>After they are all blowdryed and combed out, we trim them up. We have special rounded scissors that always give a clean look. We trim their paw pads up and give them a sanitary trim. After this we spray them with our signature pet safe perfume and give them a treat for putting up with us!</p>
