      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Do you struggle to find customers for your cat grooming business? I specialize in making websites for small businesses like you, so that you are able to get more traffic and look credible! Most people are looking online for trustworthy groomers, and if you don't have a website- or one that looks sketchy- people aren't likely to trust you with their beloved cats. A website that will allow people to see your credentials, testimonials, your contact info and more! Not only will you get a lot of exposure this way, you will also appear reliable and professional. 
         Some of the feedback I got was that I should share why I am more qualified than someone else to make this website for them. I was also told I had a lot of the word "more" in there, so I tried to eliminate those. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience for this website are going to be loving cat owners that want to spoil their cats. The specific target audience is childess millenials, as those are the people most likely to be going all out for their cats. They will most likely be inbetween the ages of 25-40, and be more "hip". These people will likely have more of a hippie/boho style, and be looking for eco friendly services and products. The target audience has a secure job, financially stable, graduated college, and making around $75,000-$100,000 annually.</p>  <!-- change this -->
