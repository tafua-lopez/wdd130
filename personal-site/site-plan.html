      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Do you struggle to find customers for your cat grooming business? I specialize in making websites for small businesses like you, so that you are able to get more traffic and look credible! Most people are looking online for trustworthy groomers, and if you don't have a website- or one that looks sketchy- people aren't likely to trust you with their beloved cats. A website that will allow people to see your credentials, testimonials, your contact info and more! Not only will you get a lot of exposure this way, you will also appear reliable and professional. 
         Some of the feedback I got was that I should share why I am more qualified than someone else to make this website for them. I was also told I had a lot of the word "more" in there, so I tried to eliminate those. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience for this website are going to be loving cat owners that want to spoil their cats. The specific target audience is childess millenials, as those are the people most likely to be going all out for their cats. They will most likely be inbetween the ages of 25-40, and be more "hip". These people will likely have more of a hippie/boho style, and be looking for eco friendly services and products. The target audience has a secure job, financially stable, graduated college, and making around $75,000-$100,000 annually.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <p>
        This page will cover the myth that cats don't need to get groomed. It will have examples of cat matting, overgrown nails, etc and other things that can be easily avoided if they are groomed. It will share where these myths stem from (self-grooming and scrathcing posts) and why they are wrong. Have some benefits from grooming listed and explained such as it can save you vet bills later, much easier for older cats that NEED grooming to get it if adjusted when younger, can catch things earlier etc.

      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        This will have the background for how and why this businesss was founded. It is going to be a small family business that started with a long line of family background in pet grooming. When they realized that the majority of groomers in the business don't take cat's into special consideration and then cats can be harmed or groomed badly, they decided to specialize on just cats for a better overall experience. Then it will have a section where you can meet the different groomers, with their names, experience, and a little bit about them.
