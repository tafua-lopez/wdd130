        <h4 class="empl-name-1">Paula Jensen</h4>
        <p class="empl-about-1">Paula founded the company in 2001 after noticing that most groomers aren't equipped to groom cats. As a cat lover herself, with 3 cats of her own, she knew this was a problem. She has been grooming cats for over 20 years now, and loves every second! Before getting into grooming she was a stay at home mom for her 3 children, one of which works at Whisker now! In her free time she loves to paint and spend time with her grandkids. </p>
        <h4 class="empl-name-2">Chloe Jensen</h4>
        <p class="empl-about-2">Chloe is the daughter of Paula. When her mom started their business she was 15 years old, and liked to help out after school. She could even be spotted helping out on weekends! After she graduated high school she took a full time position at Whisker. Overall, she has had hand on experience with cat grooming for about 4 years now. She will graduate from Utah State this summer with a degree in Business, and plans to keep working at Whisker. She enjoys hiking with her friends in her spare time. </p>

        <h4 class="empl-name-3">Bee O'Connell</h4>
        <p class="empl-about-3">Bee has been working with animals since she was 16 by volunteering at shelters. She grew up with constant foster animals, and that is where her love for animals began. At 18 she started training to get her grooming certificate, and shortly after joined our crew. She has 8 years of experience total, and loves it! She has a cat and a dog at home, and they get along great. Her favorite activity outside of work is to bake! We love her extra cookies that she brings in! If your lucky, you might get one too!  </p>
        <h4 class="empl-name-4">Eva Xiong</h4>
        <p class="empl-about-4">Eva has been with us since the beginning! She started working here in 2002, and has 20 years of experience under her belt. Eva wasn't allowed to have cats growing up, but she made up for that when she went off on her own. Now she has 4 cats and 2 beautiful children. She graduated in 2001 from Sac state with a degree in Animal Science. Her favorite way to spend her free time is to ski in the winter or water skiing in the summer. </p>
