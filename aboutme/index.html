    <p>Hello, my name is Diego! I've been married to my wife Piper for 2 years. In January, we started fostering two sweet girls, Phoebe and Paizlie. We also have 3 cat children together. Their names are Darkling, Gus, and Tie-Dye. We live here in Rexburg, but I am unable to attend in-person classes because of my work schedule.</p>
    <p>I am studying psychology with hopes of joining the FBI. This class has little to do with my future plans, but my wife highly recommended it as an extra curricular. She is a freelance web designer and wants me to be able to understand her computer lingo. </p>
    <p>I think this class and web design in general is important because if I come across a poorly designed webiste- it loses all credibilty for me. Even though I am a harsh judge, I think it would be good for me to gain some appreciation for what goes into making them.  </p>
